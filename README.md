## Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using Next.js with the App Router, ensuring a modern, efficient structure for both server-side rendering and client-side navigation.

**Key Components:**

- **Layout (`app/layout.tsx`):**  
  Provides the overall structure including Header, Footer, and Analytics integration.

- **Pages:**
  - **Home (`app/page.tsx`):** Landing page offering an overview of the platform.
  - **Experiences (`app/experiences/page.tsx`):** Displays the list of interview experiences.
  - **Submit (`app/submit/page.tsx`):** Contains the form for submitting new interview experiences.
  - **About (`app/about/page.tsx`):** Provides information about the platform.
  - **Login (`app/login/page.tsx`):** Handles user authentication.

- **Reusable Components:**
  - **Header (`app/components/Header.tsx`):** Navigation and user authentication status.
  - **Footer (`app/components/Footer.tsx`):** Consistent footer across the site.
  - **ExperienceList (`app/components/ExperienceList.tsx`):** Renders a list of experiences.
  - **ExperienceDetail (`app/components/ExperienceDetail.tsx`):** Detailed view for a single experience.
  - **SearchFilters (`app/components/SearchFilters.tsx`):** Filtering options for experiences.

### Backend Architecture

The backend utilizes Next.js API Routes for serverless functions, working seamlessly with Supabase for database operations.

**Key Features:**

- **Server-side Rendering:**  
  Improves SEO and performance by rendering pages on the server.

- **API Routes:**  
  Dedicated endpoints for data fetching, mutations, and form submissions.

- **Server Actions:**  
  Handle critical operations like submitting new interview experiences.

### Database Schema

The project uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) to store data with the following schema:

- **Users Table:**
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `email` (text, unique)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)

- **Experiences Table:**
  - `id` (bigint, primary key)
  - `user_id` (UUID, foreign key referencing Users)
  - `company` (text)
  - `role` (text)
  - `date` (date)
  - `location` (text)
  - `interview_type` (text)
  - `branch` (text)
  - `overall_experience` (text)
  - `tips` (text)
  - `salary` (text, nullable)
  - `difficulty` (text)
  - `outcome` (text)
  - `likes` (integer)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)

- **Rounds Table:**
  - `id` (bigint, primary key)
  - `experience_id` (bigint, foreign key referencing Experiences)
  - `round_name` (text)
  - `description` (text)

- **Questions Table:**
  - `id` (bigint, primary key)
  - `round_id` (bigint, foreign key referencing Rounds)
  - `question` (text)

### Authentication Flow

1. **Sign Up:**  
   Users sign up with their VIT student email (`@vitstudent.ac.in`).

2. **Email Verification:**  
   A verification email is sent; the account becomes active only after verification.

3. **Login:**  
   Firebase Authentication manages user sessions and provides client-side session tracking using `onAuthStateChanged`.

### Data Flow

- **Fetching Experiences:**
  - The `getExperiences` function (in `lib/db.ts`) calls a Supabase RPC function.
  - Data is fetched server-side on the Experiences page and rendered via the `ExperienceList` component.

- **Submitting Experiences:**
  - Form data is collected on the Submit page.
  - The `createExperience` function (in `lib/db.ts`) processes submissions and inserts data into multiple tables (Experiences, Rounds, Questions).

- **Liking Experiences:**
  - The `likeExperience` function (in `lib/db.ts`) updates the likes count using optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback.
